## Ring and Spinner

### Description

We were supposed to diivde up the work and create a part called Ring and Spinner. I was Partner A so I created the Ring and my Parnter created the Spinner.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape assignment of the year and it was pretty easy thing to create. I learned a new tool called "Chamfer" and it is similar to the fillet. This assignment was overall easy because it told us everything that we needed to do. It had all the instructions on it, but I know that when I have to create a part myself it might be a little challenging.

## Key and Prop

### Description
Next part to this series was the Key and Prop. I created the Key since I was Student A, and my partner created the Prop. What we created was a key that would make a copter turn when it was inserted into the key hole.

### Reflection
I relearned a toll that I knew a while ago, but I had forgotten it since I didn't use it for a while. It was called the linear pattern which repeats a part as many times as you need it. I had to make the teeth on the key so I used the linear pattern to repeat this teeth many times fast instead of manually creating each single teeth.
