## Ring and Spinner

### Description

We were supposed to diivde up the work and create a part called Ring and Spinner. I was Partner A so I created the Ring and my Parnter created the Spinner.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape assignment of the year and it was pretty easy thing to create. I learned a new tool called "Chamfer" and it is similar to the fillet. This assignment was overall easy because it told us everything that we needed to do. It had all the instructions on it, but I know that when I have to create a part myself it might be a little challenging.

## Key and Prop

### Description
Next part to this series was the Key and Prop. I created the Key since I was Student A, and my partner created the Prop. What we created was a key that would make a copter turn when it was inserted into the key hole.

### Reflection
I relearned a toll that I knew a while ago, but I had forgotten it since I didn't use it for a while. It was called the linear pattern which repeats a part as many times as you need it. I had to make the teeth on the key so I used the linear pattern to repeat this teeth many times fast instead of manually creating each single teeth. 


## Pull Copter Assembly

### Description
 For the Final part we just assembled the parts we created and it turned out great.

### Reflection

This was an easy build and we got it done earlier than it was due. I didn't have any problems with it, but I would give one advice which to communicate. You have to communicate with your partner so you can understand each other and know what you're doing and what needs to be done. This was what helped us to finish this early and perfectly.

## Branch and erge

### Description

We made a new branch and tranformed our parts to look different than the normal one.

### Reflection
I learned a new way of making my Onshape skills better. The branch is a place that you can create or upgrade an existing part without affecting the origninal one. That is a really helpful tool to use and if anyone wants to make their design better without affecting the one they have now then I suggest branchng it. It is a ton of help and very very useful.
