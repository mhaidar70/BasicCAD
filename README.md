### Description

We were supposed to diivde up the work and create a part called Ring and Spinner. I was Partner A so I created the Ring and my Parnter created the Spinner.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape assignment of the year and it was pretty easy thing to create. I learned a new tool called "Chamfer" and it is similar to the fillet. This assignment was overall easy because it told us everything that we needed to do. It had all the instructions on it, but I know that when I have to create a part myself it might be a little challenging.
