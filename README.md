## Ring and Spinner

### Description

We were supposed to divde up the work and create a part called Ring and Spinner. I was Partner A so I created the Ring and my Partner created the Spinner.

This is the image of the Ring that I created in Onshape.

### Reflection
This was my first Onshape assignment of the year and it was pretty easy thing to create. I learned a new tool called "Chamfer" and it is similar to the fillet. This assignment was overall easy because it told us everything that we needed to do. It had all the instructions on it, but I know that when I have to create a part myself it might be a little challenging.


## Key and Prop

### Description
Next part to this series was the Key and Prop. I created the Key since I was Student A, and my partner created the Prop. What we created was a key that would make a copter turn when it was inserted into the key hole.

### Reflection
I relearned a lot I knew a while ago, but I had forgotten it since I didn't use it for a while. It was called the linear pattern which repeats a part as many times as you need it. I had to make the teeth on the key so I used the linear pattern to repeat this teeth many times fast instead of manually creating each single teeth. 


## Pull Copter Assembly

### Description
 For the Final part we just assembled the parts we created and it turned out great.

### Reflection

This was an easy build and we got it done earlier than it was due. I didn't have any problems with it, but I would give one advice which to communicate. You have to communicate with your partner so you can understand each other and know what you're doing and what needs to be done. This was what helped us to finish this early and perfectly.


## Branch and Merge

### Description

We made a new branch and transformed our parts to look different than the normal one. 

### Evidence
[Here is our Onshape Document where the changes were made](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/1cde1131899ecaf84965423d/w/7f185f7fa3bee0fa40ee25e7/e/c17c2a21e748b4aecc6d31cf)

The image shows the key changed from a circular handle to a square.

### Reflection
I learned a new way of making my Onshape skills better. The branch is a place that you can create or upgrade an existing part without affecting the origninal one. That is a really helpful tool to use and if anyone wants to make their design better without affecting the one they have now then I suggest branchng it. It is a ton of help and very very useful.


## Multi Part Studio

### Description
 We made a part on Onshape using the drawings that were given to us. 

### Image

### Reflection

I would like to say that this was very very confusing. I had no idea where to start because there were different parts that had confusing dimensions. I got help from Mr. H, and he told me to start with the caps since they were almost identical. I just thought hm I need to start from easy then we can make progress then go to the hard parts. So just start from easy parts then move on to harder and harder parts. A good tip is also just get someone that knows what they are doing to check to see if you're on the right path. If you weren't then you kept going and eventually you're going to get one part wrong then that will cause you to restart the whole thing.


## Swing Arm

### Description 
The goal of this assignment was to create a swing arm in Onshape by using drawings that was given to us.

### Reflection

Although, I knew what the variable function did, I forgot to use it when creating the swing arm. I didn't realize until my teacher saw what I was doing, and it would have caused a lot of errors like the swing arm looking disfigured if I kept on changing the measurements. To fix it I used a variable which I could change the length, width, and the angle of it at anytime without the part looking nasty. 


## Toggle Clamp

### Description

In this assignment, our main focus was on assembling a toggle clamp and later answering questions on the assembly.

### Reflection

Making mistakes while creating this really frustrated me because I would think that I got the right answer but I was wrong because of a slight mistake in the previous part of the assembly. However, each mistake taught me a valuable lesson and helped me improve my skills. I also learned that taking my time and paying attention to details can help prevent mistakes in the future. 

## Onshape Certification

### Description

We prepared and took an exam to be Onshape certified. 

### Reflection

Onshape certification was a challenging task for me because honestly I didn't prepare well for it. We had a few assignments to help us review and prepare for our exam but I didn't complete the assignments completely, only doing it until I knew and left the rest of it. This was a crucial mistake that I regret now because I could have took a couple hours out of my day to pass this, but I didn't. Although I made a huge mistake, I did learn that an opportunity given is a opportunity to succeed and learn. In the future, I will take any opportunity that comes my way and try my best to do it and ask for help whenever it is needed.
